# ConvoSense UI Principles

This document outlines the UI principles that guide the design and development of the ConvoSense application. These principles are intended to ensure a consistent, intuitive, and accessible user experience.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity and Simplicity

The UI should be clean, uncluttered, and easy to understand. The primary focus is on the conversation, with all other elements designed to be secondary and unobtrusive.

- **Minimalist Design**: The UI avoids unnecessary visual elements and focuses on the essential components of the chat interface.
- **Clear Information Hierarchy**: The layout and typography are designed to guide the user's attention to the most important information, such as the message content and sender details.

### 2. Consistency and Familiarity

The UI should be consistent throughout the application, and it should leverage familiar design patterns to make the user experience intuitive and predictable.

- **Consistent Component Library**: The application uses a consistent set of UI components from **ShadCN UI**, ensuring a uniform look and feel across all pages.
- **Familiar Chat Interface**: The chat interface follows a conventional design, with messages displayed in bubbles and a clear distinction between the sender and receiver.

### 3. Accessibility

The application should be accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. The UI is designed to be inclusive and to comply with accessibility best practices.

- **Semantic HTML**: The application uses semantic HTML to ensure that the content is well-structured and can be easily interpreted by screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation, and the focus is managed to provide a seamless experience for keyboard users.
- **Color Contrast**: The color palette is designed to provide sufficient contrast between text and background elements, ensuring readability for users with visual impairments.

### 4. Feedback and Control

The UI should provide clear feedback to the user and give them control over their actions. The user should always be aware of the current state of the application and should be able to easily undo or cancel actions.

- **Real-Time Updates**: The application provides real-time feedback on the status of messages, such as whether they have been sent, delivered, or read.
- **Translation Preview**: The user can preview the translation of a message before sending it, giving them control over the final output.
- **Loading and Sending Indicators**: The UI provides clear indicators when the application is loading data or sending a message, so the user is always aware of what is happening.

## UI Components

The application is built using a set of reusable UI components from **ShadCN UI**, which are customized to match the application's design system.

- **Buttons**: The buttons are designed to be easily recognizable and to provide clear feedback when pressed.
- **Forms**: The forms are designed to be easy to use and to provide clear validation messages.
- **Dialogs and Modals**: The dialogs and modals are designed to be unobtrusive and to provide a clear and focused user experience.
- **Tooltips**: The tooltips are used to provide additional information about UI elements without cluttering the interface.

## Styling

The application is styled using **Tailwind CSS**, with a custom theme defined in `tailwind.config.ts`. The styling is designed to be consistent, maintainable, and responsive.

- **Responsive Design**: The UI is designed to be responsive and to adapt to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop computers.
- **Consistent Color Palette**: The application uses a consistent color palette to create a cohesive and visually appealing user experience.
- **Typography**: The typography is designed to be readable and to create a clear information hierarchy.
